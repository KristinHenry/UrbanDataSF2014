UrbanDataSF2014
===============

On February 22nd, 2014, I took part in a the Urban Data Challenge Hackathon in San Francisco.
Other members of the team included Jesse Day, Skott Kildall, Karen Marcelo, Eric Socolfsky

I've included here, my code for reshaping the data as we recieved it into a flat and more compressed format, with a flattened version of the data in a csv file. 

This reduces the data file size from 14,943.752 kb to 1,295.538 kb, without loosing data.


Also included, are my notes from the beginning of the hackathon.

Skott's repo of the animation is here: https://github.com/scottkildall/JEKKS
